# HTTP Transport Implementation - COMPLETED

**Status**: âœ… Completed on January 16, 2025

## Summary

Implemented HTTP transport layer for the MCP service to enable external access beyond VS Service Broker.

## Implementation

- Used HttpListener (built into .NET Framework 4.8)
- Forwards JSON-RPC 2.0 requests to existing MCPService
- No authentication (per MCP standard practice)
- Default port 3000 configuration

## Components Added

1. **MCPHttpServer**: HttpListener-based server implementation
2. **IHttpServer**: Interface for HTTP server transport
3. **Commands**:
   - StartMCPHttpServerCommand
   - StopMCPHttpServerCommand
   - ShowMCPHttpStatusCommand
   - TestMCPHttpCommand

## Results

Successfully tested with curl and can:
- Initialize MCP sessions
- List available tools and resources
- Execute tool calls (get projects, find symbols, translate paths)
- Read resources (solution info, project details)

## Next Steps

- Add dynamic configuration for port/host
- Create usage documentation
- Consider authentication for production use
