# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

We're implementing a complete restart and simplification of the MCP server implementation. After evaluating the current codebase, we've determined that a clean-slate approach focusing only on what AI assistants truly need will result in a more maintainable and performant solution.

### Current Focus Areas

1. **Restart Plan Implementation**:
   - ✓ Created restart-plan.md with a phased approach for clean-slate implementation
   - ✓ Identified core requirements for AI assistants working with VS solutions
   - ✓ Outlined detailed service interfaces to replace complex hybrid architecture
   - ✓ Clarified that we should NOT deliver file content - AI assistants read directly from disk
   - ✓ Emphasized the "one level down" principle for performance
   - ✓ Completed Phase 1 (cleanup) by moving complex files to to_delete folder
   - ✓ Completed Phase 2 (core service implementations)
   - ✓ Completed Phase 3 (API controllers implementation)
   - ✓ Completed Phase 4 (core infrastructure updates)
   - ⏳ Working on detailed API testing and documentation
   - ❗ Need to complete more comprehensive tests and documentation

2. **Service Implementation Status**:
   - ✓ Implemented ISolutionStructureService for solution/project structure
   - ✓ Created ISymbolLocationService interface and implemented SymbolLocationService
   - ✓ Created IPathTranslationService interface and implemented PathTranslationService
   - ✓ Created IProjectCommandService interface and implemented ProjectCommandService
   - ✓ Implemented MSBuildWorkspaceManager for symbol resolution
   - ✓ Added Microsoft.Build.Locator package for proper MSBuild initialization

3. **API Implementation Status**:
   - ✓ Updated JsonRpcController.cs to use new streamlined services
   - ✓ Created new ApiController.cs with REST endpoints
   - ✓ Added comprehensive Swagger documentation
   - ✓ Implemented proper error handling and timeouts
   - ✓ Created API-test-curl-cmds.md for endpoint testing
   - ⏳ Testing and debugging API endpoints one by one
   - ❌ Found issues with path translation endpoint returning 404
   - ❌ Many API endpoints not appearing to work correctly
   - ❗ Need to fix API controller implementation and routing

4. **Core Principles Established**:
   - ✓ Stateless operations to avoid complex state management
   - ✓ Focused functionality providing only what's needed
   - ✓ Performance optimization with "one level down" approach
   - ✓ Simplicity in service interfaces and models
   - ✓ No file content delivery - AI assistants read directly from disk
   - ✓ Configurable settings with JSON persistence
   - ✓ Proper error handling with appropriate status codes

## Active Decisions

1. **Clean-Slate Approach**:
   - Created a fresh implementation based on lessons learned
   - Deleted overly complex components and rebuilt simpler versions
   - Kept good elements like path translation while replacing problematic areas
   - Focused only on what AI assistants truly need for VS solutions
   - Avoided fancy techniques and overcomplicated solutions
