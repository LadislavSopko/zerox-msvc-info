# Product Context

## Project Vision

The MSVC MCP Server is a Visual Studio extension that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server within Visual Studio. 
It creates a bridge between Visual Studio's rich project system and AI assistants, enabling context-aware AI development tools to work effectively with VS solutions.

## Problems Solved

1. **VS-AI Integration Gap**: 
   - AI assistants lack deep understanding of Visual Studio projects
   - Traditional methods of sharing code with AI tools don't include project context

2. **Cross-Environment Challenges**:
   - Developing with Windows (Visual Studio) and WSL (AI tools) creates friction
   - Path differences between environments cause context misalignment

3. **Context Building Overhead**:
   - Developers manually explain project structure to AI tools
   - Considerable time spent providing context rather than solving problems

4. **Large Solution Handling**:
   - Performance challenges when processing large solutions
   - Need for selective context sharing and progressive loading

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Personas

1. **Developer using Windows + WSL**:
   - Works in Visual Studio on Windows
   - Uses AI assistants in WSL
   - Needs seamless context sharing between environments

2. **AI Tool Developer**:
   - Builds AI-powered development tools
   - Needs standard protocol to access Visual Studio project information
   - Requires robust, well-structured data about solutions and projects

### Key Experience Requirements

1. **Seamless Context Sharing**:
   - Start MCP server with a single click in Visual Studio
   - AI tools automatically discover and connect to the MCP server
   - Project context flows naturally to AI assistants without manual intervention

2. **Performance Under Scale**:
   - Responsive experience even with large solutions
   - Smart caching and progressive loading
   - No UI freezing or timeouts

3. **Cross-Platform Path Handling**:
   - Automatic path translation between Windows and WSL formats
   - Relative paths work correctly in both environments
   - Developers don't need to manually translate paths

4. **Comprehensive Project Understanding**:
   - AI tools receive full solution structure
   - Project relationships and dependencies are clear
   - File context includes language and project membership information

5. **Standard Protocol Implementation**:
   - Follows official MCP specification
   - Compatible with all MCP-compliant clients
   - Extensible for Visual Studio-specific features
