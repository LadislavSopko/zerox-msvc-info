# Service Broker Implementation - COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ Completed on January 16, 2024

## Summary

Successfully implemented VS Service Broker integration for the MCP service, creating a clean architecture that follows VS extensibility patterns.

## Implementation

- Created IMCPService interface with static configuration
- Implemented MCPService with BrokeredServiceConfiguration
- Simplified service registration using ProfferBrokeredService
- Removed unnecessary abstractions (factory pattern, separate RPC target)

## Architecture

```
Extension Entry Point → ProfferBrokeredService → MCPService
                                              ↓
                                        ServiceBroker.GetProxyAsync
```

## Key Components

1. **IMCPService**: Interface defining MCP protocol methods
2. **MCPService**: Implementation with JSON-RPC handlers
3. **Service Registration**: Clean integration with VS Service Broker
4. **Test Commands**: Validation tools for service functionality

## Results

- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Full JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance
- All MCP methods implemented
- Proper VS integration patterns
- Working test commands
